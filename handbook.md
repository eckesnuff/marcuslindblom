## ASSUME THE BEST

Our default setting is to always believe the best about the people we work with. That goes for both client and team interactions, from the smallest bit of feedback to the biggest ask. When a problem pops up, we address it mindfully, with thoughtful questions and a listening ear. We let communication, curiosity, and positivity be our guides, rather than quick assumptions and reactions.
